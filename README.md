# Calorie Tracker

Welcome to my Calorie Tracker! This React application allows you to easily monitor your daily food intake by entering any food item, and it will estimate the calories for you. It features a simple and intuitive interface that helps you stay on top of your nutrition goals.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

Food Entry: Enter any food item, and the app will guess the calories using the ChatGPT API.

Daily Calorie Bar: Track how many calories you've consumed throughout the day with a visual bar representation.

User Storage: Plans to implement a database for user storage, allowing personalized tracking and history.

Manual Calorie Adjustment: Future plans to add an option for users to manually change calorie assumptions for greater accuracy.

### Tech Stack
Front End: Built with React and JavaScript, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience.

ChatGPT API: Utilized to estimate calorie counts based on user input.

### Learning Experience

While working on this project, I learned valuable lessons about API integration and user experience design. Unfortunately, I had to pause development when my ChatGPT API key was stolen after I accidentally published it on GitHub. This incident was a real eye-opener regarding API security and version control, and I vow it will never happen again!
